              <p>
                You are going to participate in a User Study designed to find out how humans perceive data represented through Heatmap Charts.<br>
                A Heatmap is a two-dimensional visual representation of data, where values are encoded in colors, delivering a convenient, insightful view of information. Essentially, this chart type is a data table with rows and columns denoting different sets of values or categories.
              <br> <p class="h6 text-justify"> About the study </p>
                We are focusing on getting Heatmap human perception to use it to evaluate the effectiveness and characteristics of these visualizations. <br> To evaluate this, we will present to you a series of Heatmap charts. Every Heatmap will represent the average number of bicycles in a station (Y axis) for a day number (X axis) from a bike sharing system.
                 <br>You will conduct 3 different tasks for each one.
                <br><br>

                 </p>
                <p class="h6 text-justify">The tasks</p>
                1. Count the number of clusters represented.
                <br>
                2. Guess the value of the cell marked in red.
                <br>
                3. Click over a cell that you think contains a value we indicate.

                <br>
                <br> <p class="h6 text-justify"> This study is structured as follows</p>

                1. Demographic Survey. First, you will be asked to provide some personal information (age, gender, quality of eyesight, etc.). We do not ask for your identity, so you will remain anonymous.
                <br>
                2.  Introductory Survey. This first introductory survey is a short example to get familiar with the tasks and evaluate your suitability  to proceed with the test, evaluating your ability to continue with the rest of the test.
                <br>
                3. Survey. Having passed the introductory task, you will begin the main survey, where you will have to answer the same tasks as the introductory survey but now with open values for the answers.
                <br>
                4. Personal Evaluation Survey. Finally, a personal evaluation survey, to gather additional comments and opinions about the study, if any.
                <br> <br>
                <p class="h6 text-justify"> Further considerations</p>
                - As a perceptual study, you should not use rulers or any other external tool to measure length.
                <br>
                - The average time to complete the study is about 20 minutes (40 - 45 seconds for each chart). However, you can spend as much time as you need to complete it.
                <br>
                - The data collected will only be used for academic purposes.
                <br>
                - You will be paid if you meet these conditions: If you complete the whole study, demographic and evaluation forms, introductory survey, and the main survey. But also your test results have to be strong, meaning, they must pass the random or nonsense detection test.
                <br>
                - Due to the nature of the study, it does not result in risks to human health.
